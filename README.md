# MaskDetection
Identifying an image of a person to know whether they are masked or not through Computer Vision which is a part of Deep Learning.

Part of the projects done in Hacktiv8 (Aug 2022 - Oct 2022), though there might still be future updates containing new informations/improvements that can be added onto the project.

From the evaluation of the improved model, it can be known that the model has already performed great. However, when it's being put into use, I still run into a problem and that is that it categorizes everything as masked. I currently have a suspicion and that is perhaps that the image resolution and proximity between the face itself and the border of the image has something to do with it, but it has yet to be tried for next improvement.
